Filament Color Samples / Test Strips by 3dingus on Thingiverse: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2453187

Summary:
Update 09/29/2017: I added several new STLs.In addition to the 10x45mm original theres now a 15mm and 20mm wide version, as well as a 40mm x 40mm square one.These are the filament samples I use to help people make a decision on filament color. Each piece has 4 different levels of thickness (0.5mm, 1.0mm, 1.5mm, 2.0mm). They are 10.0mm x 45.0mm and have a loop to easily store them on a string or keyring.Print time at 0.15mm layer height is about 5 minutes.
