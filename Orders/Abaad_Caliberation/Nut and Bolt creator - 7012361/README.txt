Nut and Bolt creator by Grandpas_Place on Thingiverse: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:7012361

Summary:
I needed to test some metric nut sizes for a lost part and could not find a true to size nut. I created this nut and bolt maker. You can set the metric size (defaults to M8) size of head, height, etc. and it will generate a pair.
