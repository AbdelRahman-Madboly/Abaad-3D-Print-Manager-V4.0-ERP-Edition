Tolerance Test 0,1 - 0,3 by _Frezap on Thingiverse: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3746019

Summary:
This is my version of a tolerance test. It fits my range of relevant tolerances: 0,1; 0,15; 0,2; 0,25 and 0,3mm.Its optimized for up to 5 or 6 wall lines to support all kinds of part strenghs.There are two versions of the pins because printing higher then the rest of the print can result in different diameters throughout the pin. So one ends with the hole board, the other extends to full length.
